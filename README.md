# Connect 5

Is a two player game that players take turns to drop a red, or yellow disk into a board. The first player to connect 5 of their disks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

The code of the game is held in GenesysConnected/src/connect5 folder. 

The game can be launched by running the GameState.java file in connect5 from IDE.

Testing - there are a number of unit tests in the TestBoard class to test the methods from Board.java.

I hope you enjoy the game.
